## Context

In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon has the ability to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures.

## Functionality

Based on randomness to determine the effectiveness of the attacks and also on the chances of capturing a pokemon, the program runs also a fighting system based on conditionals on whether the enemy used certain attack, multiplied by the effectiveness and a whole other system that calculates the matchups based on the elements of the pokemons themselves! This is a school project, that will be updated constantly within the following month.
